The `center_of_mass.py` script calculates the weighted center of mass for PDB and PDBQT files.

Atomic mass units are considered for the weighted center of mass calculation, a list of those atomic weights can be found at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elements)

<br>
<br>

### Requirements:

- Python 2.7.x or Python 3.x

<br>
<br>

### Usage:

run `python center_of_mass.py --help` for the usage information:

<pre>
usage: center_of_mass.py [-h] [-i coordinate-ID] PDBfile

Calculates the weighted center of mass for structures in a PDB file.
By default, all atoms in the PDB file are included in the calculation.

positional arguments:
  PDBfile

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i coordinate-ID, --include coordinate-ID
                        Coordinate lines to include (default: "ATOM,HETATM")

</pre>

### Example 1: center of mass of a protein

command:

	python center_of_mass.py protein.pdb -i ATOM

output:

	[-8.125, 20.461, -10.438]

**Tip:**

You can generate a pseudo atom in PyMol (as shown in the image above) via the following code:

	pseudoatom com, resi=40, b=40, color=red, pos=[-8.125, 20.461, -10.438]

### Example 2: center of mass of a ligand

command:

	python center_of_mass.py protein.pdb -i HETATM

output:

	[-2.491, 30.038, -10.765]
