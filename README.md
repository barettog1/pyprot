## Scripts and command line tools

PyProt provides ready-to-use command line scripts that are using the underlying `pyprot` objects to work with PDB and MOL2 files.  
The scripts are located in the subdirectory `./scripts` and can be used after `pyprot` was successfully installed.

- Working with PDB files
    - [Center of Mass](./docs/tools/pdb_center_of_mass.md)
    - [Grab atoms within a radius](./docs/tools/pdb_grab_atom_radius.md)
    - [Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)](./docs/tools/pdb_rmsd.md)
    - [PDB to FASTA converter](./docs/tools/pdb_to_fasta.md)
    - [PDB atom and residue renumbering](./docs/tools/pdb_renumber.md)
    - [B-factor statistics](./docs/tools/pdb_bfactor_stats.md)
